```
    I am accessing the Eventbrite search API and gathering:
    - 50 Events for each of 2 cities I'm going to search for
    - For each event, I'll be accessing the name, start and end times, description, and if the price of admissions is free or a cost.
    - I'll write 2 CSV files, one for each city's search
    - Data in each CSV file: 5 columns -- Name, Start, End, Description, Price
    - URL for the API: <https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/>
    - If necessary, URL describing the authentication process for the API: <https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/api_overview/authentication/>
```
