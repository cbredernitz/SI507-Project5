b'Richard & Hinda Rosenthal Symposium: Pain & the Opioid Epidemic: A Path Forward',2017-11-27T15:00:00,2017-11-27T17:30:00,"

Co-hosted by the National Academy of Medicine and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
Ford Auditorium | University of Michigan, Ann Arbor3:00-5:30 PMLive webcast available
This year’s symposium will focus on how challenges associated with managing acute and chronic pain have led to an explosion in the abuse of prescription pain medications and a nationwide epidemic. Panelists will consider how to inform health care policies that impact the opioid epidemic by asking:  


How can we use the wealth of epidemiological, clinical, and basic science information about the biology of pain and addiction to stem the opioid epidemic?


What can be done now?


What should be done in the longer term?



Pioneering pain researcher, Dr. Allan Basbaum, Professor and Chair of the Department of Anatomy at the University of California, San Francisco, and member of the National Academy of Medicine, will describe the current understanding of the neurobiology of pain and discuss opportunities to translate knowledge about basic research into treatments for various types of pain, as the country continues to confront real life challenges.
 The plenary lecture will be followed by a panel of University of Michigan faculty who will address various facets of the opioid epidemic across a wide range of disciplines; including:

Epidemiological aspects of opioid use and abuse
Clinical aspects of acute and chronic pain treatment
Neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that predispose to substance use and addiction, and
Molecular and pharmacological aspects of opioid actions

A closing reception for all guests will follow the symposium. 
About the Rosenthal Symposium: Through the generosity of the Richard & Hinda Rosenthal Foundation, the National Academy of Medicine hosts an annual symposium to bring greater attention to critical health policy issues facing our country today. Learn more: NAM.edu/Rosenthal.

Keynotes by Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard and Financial Times' US Managing Editor Gillian Tett
Financial technology, or FinTech, can be traced back to the introduction of the telegraph in the 1860s. As internet technology became available, FinTech has evolved rapidly. Financial firms digitized their processes, and companies began introducing consumer-facing products such as online banking and payments. Today, FinTech continues to disrupt and evolve, not only in how financial products and services are delivered, but who delivers them. Regulators and market participants face challenges in understanding and balancing the benefits of FinTech against potential risks. Innovation helps catalyze growth and new opportunities while generating new risks. Regulatory structures in place could fail to accommodate changes in the financial marketplace. Regulators may overreact to new technologies, stifling innovation and locking in old forms of doing business. At the same time, regulatory complacency can have disastrous results, permitting the buildup of systemic risk or widespread consumer harms.
This conference will explore how the private sector, researchers, and policymakers can harness the upside potential of financial innovation while reducing the downside risks.

Automotive Futures Group
INSIDE CHINA:  UNDERSTANDING CHINA'S CURRENT AND FUTURE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY 
Our 10th annual Inside China Automotive Conference features insights by manufacturers, suppliers, consultants, and UM experts on the current and future prospects for the automotive industry in China. The Chinese market continues to be the largest automotive market in the world despite a recent slowdown. The government is challenged to manage the environmental impact of vehicle production and operation, trying to balance the explosive growth of its economy with the need to create a sustainable environment. Its focus on electric vehicles in the auto industry is one approach it is taking to support sustainability. Autonomous vehicles are also beginning to play a role in future development.
This year our speakers will discuss many of the most important issues related to the industry including current vehicle sales environment, the global ambitions of their domestic manufacturers and suppliers, the electric vehicle strategies of Chinese manufacturers, the new government policies that are supporting electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles, and the environmental impact of a large scale deployment. They will also discuss the impact of new connected vehicle technology and the industry and government support needed to take advantage of this new technology. As with past conferences, we will focus on future industry trends in market structure and the roles of both the domestic and foreign manufacturers and suppliers in the industry.
Some of the key questions we will address include: What are the current consumer trends in vehicle purchasing, and what are some of the potential future buying patterns? What are the new electric and connected and autonomous vehicle strategies put forth by the government? How do they differ from previous regulations and why might they be more or less successful? What companies are leading China’s domestic electric vehicle industry? What are some of the environmental impacts that researchers see being affected by the growth of the electric vehicle industry? How are or will the foreign manufacturers respond to the new regulations? How are foreign and domestic joint venture partners preparing for a day when JVs will not be required?
Confirmed Speakers include:
Bruce Belzowski, Managing Director, Automotive Futures, UM Transportation Research Institute, will moderate the conference.
Michael Andrews, HMI Team Lead, Intelligent and Connected Vehicle Group, Changan US R&D Center, will discuss some of his company’s market, product development, and R&D plans for China, the US, and the rest of the globe.
Jun Ma, Vice Dean for the Automotive College at Tongji University, China will present his research on how China is experimenting with autonomous vehicles within the context of planned cities that will be able to take advantage of these vehicles.
Other manufacturers, suppliers, government representatives, and consultants have been invited

WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION

 La’Ron Williams, B.F.A., Professional Storyteller and Racial Justice Educator
Nationally acclaimed and multiple award-winning storyteller La’Ron Williams presents programs that are specifically designed to promote diversity, foster community building, encourage peaceful conflict resolution, and teach a host of pro-social skills.  For business organizations and non-profits, he presents diversity workshops that help participants to understand the nature of “invisible” bias and to move beyond the emotional stumbling blocks that prevent them from taking collective responsibility for creating a just and equitable society.  La’Ron is a member of the Racial and Economic Justice Task Force of the Ann Arbor based Interfaith Council for Peace and Justice, and is a founding member of “Washtenaw Faces Race”, an all-volunteer, inter-racial, interdisciplinary group who consciously and consistently work to dismantle racial hierarchy and promote racial equity in local institutions within Washtenaw County.
The United States started with an act of declaration rooted in a set of noble ideals that for the past two and a half centuries have formed our national creed: Freedom, equality, “liberty and justice for all."" At the same time, we’ve maintained a set of social practices that directly contradicted those ideals. Any realistic examination of U.S. history clearly shows that democracy has never been more than a guiding principle.
Even so, although our democratic ideals have been severely compromised, they’ve provided a strong and compelling goal toward which many Americans have aspired.
Today, this has changed. Over the past 50 years or so, huge numbers of Americans have lost faith in the idea of a citizen-driven, responsible, reliable democratic government. Whether on the local, state, or federal level, many Americans believe themselves to exist in an adversarial relationship with their legislators, and with the entire political process.
But isn’t our government supposed to be us? Has democracy itself failed, or are our democratic ideals losing credibility in the face of other corrupting social forces? If other forces are at fault, then what exactly are they? Can their origins be traced to choices we’ve made throughout our history? If we still believe in democracy as an ideal, then how can it be rescued?

THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES, 1787-1877 
1:25 PM – 2:25 PM 
Howard Brick, Ph.D., Louis Evans Professor of History, University of Michigan
Howard Brick is Louis Evans Professor of History, University of Michigan.  He is author of Radicals in America: The US Left since the Second World War, with Christopher Phelps (2015); Transcending Capitalism: Visions of a New Society in Modern American Thought (2006); Age of Contradiction: American Thought and Culture in the 1960s (2000); and Daniel Bell and the Decline of Intellectual Radicalism (1986). Work in progress includes a study of how global decolonization in the mid-twentieth century recast theories of world history.
This session is intended to serve as a kind of primer on the general qualities/values of democracy as that was understood roughly in the first century of U.S. history—from the Constitution of 1787 through the end of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states.  The meaning of democracy changed over time, and even as people came to describe the United States as a democracy, the ideals of democracy posed a challenge to the realities of US government and politics. What are the qualities of democracy that give it value for today?

DEMOCRACY AND THE AMERICAN REALITY 
2:35 PM – 3:35 PM
Peter Hammer, J.D., Ph.D., Director of Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights, Professor of Law, Wayne State University
A professor at Wayne State University Law School since 2003, Peter Hammer is the director of the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights. The Keith Center is dedicated to promoting the educational, economic and political empowerment of under-represented communities in urban areas and to ensuring that the phrase ""equal justice under law"" applies to all members of society. Professor Hammer was instrumental in editing and compiling Judge Damon J. Keith's new biography, Crusader for Justice: Federal Judge Damon J. Keith (2013). Professor Hammer has become a leading voice on the economic and social issues impacting the city of Detroit, and has added new courses to the law school curriculum on ""Race, Law and Social Change in Southeast Michigan"" and ""Re-Imagining Development in Detroit: Institutions, Law & Society.""
 America was established on the back of lofty democratic ideals. But has America ever really lived out its creed – even by its own standards? In what ways has our professed belief in democracy been compromised in order to accommodate our lived realities of geographic expansion, and race, gender, and class hierarchy? What effect did our historical compromises have on the shape of our society during its first 200 years?

3:35 PM - 3:45 PM

DEMOCRACY OR RACIAL OLIGARCHY? 
3:45 PM – 4:45 PM 
Vincent Hutchings, Ph.D., Professor of Political Science and Research Professor at the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan
Vincent Hutchings is a Professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan and a Research Professor at the Institute for Social Research. He has explored the ways in which political campaigns can frame information about racial issues in order to activate and make politically relevant voter attitudes about particular racial groups. Current work focuses on inter-racial and inter-ethnic competition and the ways in which elite communications can exacerbate or diminish inter-group conflict. He is currently the co-Principal Investigator of the American National Election Study (ANES).  Professor Hutchings authored Public Opinion and Democratic Accountability (2003). His work has appeared in the American Sociological Review, the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Politics, the Annual Review of Political Science, Political Communication, Public Opinion Quarterly, Political Psychology, the Journal of Communication and Legislative Studies Quarterly.
What has happened to democracy over the last fifty years or so? What have been the most notable democratic victories and set-backs in that time? Why has there been a massive national turn toward the acceptance of right-wing authoritarianism, and what threat does this pose to the ideals that historically have underscored our aspirational democratic center? This session will focus primarily on the right-wing backlash of the past 50 years or so, especially that which has taken place in the wake of the Civil Rights movement. It will describe the development of the general lack of faith Americans feel about the efficacy of citizenship, reflect upon the connections between the ways the widespread political and social manipulation of race and class acted to thwart democratic practice in the past, and show how that same manipulation currently is being used to erode our national faith in our democratic principles. It will illuminate how/why in recent years we’ve had a government that ignores/contradicts/flouts established guiding democratic principles, and point out the danger this poses. 

Closing
 4:45 PM to 5:10 PM 
La’Ron Williams, B.F.A., Professional Storyteller and Racial Justice Educator
 Biography: (See his bio. listed above for his Welcome and Introduction talk)
What can we do to rescue democracy? In this session, Washtenaw Faces Race will offer suggestions for steps that can be taken to address the current challenges to America’s democratic ideals. We will allow time for attendees to make connections with area groups who are already involved in actions to maintain democracy. 
At the same time, we will advocate for an additional step: We assert that what passes for democracy under the current status quo in this country is neither benign nor neutral. In fact, we assert that in practice, we remain so far from our democratic values that we cannot even accurately be called a democracy. We raise the question: How does one ""protect"" or ""defend"" something that has never really existed? Instead, we believe that we must, in full awareness of our historic choices and the effects they have had on our social set-up, consciously make the decision to rescue our democratic ideals, to declare them to be our shared national goal, to advocate for their realization, and to work together to make it so. We believe it's time for a new, organized campaign based on a collective citizen demand to become in reality the land of freedom and justice that we claim we’ve always been. ",Free

Special Presentation:
The Science on Using the USDA Soil Classification for the Volatilization to Indoor Air Pathway
Featured Speaker: Matt Williams, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality
Abstract:  In the environmental industry, we most commonly log soils using the Unified Soil Classification System designating soils as well-graded sands, clayey gravels, silt, etc.  Many of us classify soils in the field through observation.  
With the emergence of the Volatilization to Indoor Air Pathway (VIAP) as a new driver on the contaminated properties we work on every day, characterization and evaluation is critical.  The science behind the characterization of soils and the equations used when evaluating the VIAP requires the classification of soils using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil classification that uses descriptions like loam, loamy sand, clay, etc.  This is a shift in practice from how many of us typically classify soils.  This presentation will help us understand the reason for using the USDA classification system, the differences between the two systems, and the methods for appropriately classifying soils based on the intended purpose for the data.
Student Poster Contest
AIPG student members are invited to bring their posters on their geologic research projects to compete for awards up to $1,000 cash in both undergraduate and graduate levels.  An AIPG member judging panel will review the posters and annouce the winners and hand out the awards at the end of the evening.

b'Christian Martin x Desert Hearts at Necto',2017-11-09T21:00:00,2017-11-10T01:00:00,"Necto presents...
Christian Martin x Desert Hearts [Mikey Lion | Lee Reynolds | Marbs | Porkchop]
Christian Martin's love affair with electronic music began in 1995, as an early attendee at Southern California's legendary Moontribe full moon desert parties. After absorbing late 90's club life in New York, London, and Los Angeles, Christian settled in San Francisco in the spring of 2000. He started playing records in 2002 under the tutelage of his brother, Justin Martin, armed with a stack of Justin's old vinyl and used Technics 1200's from Sammy D.
In 2003, inspired by the massive desert soundsystems of old, Christian founded the dirtybird soundsystem. Along with co-founders Justin Martin, Worthy, and Claude VonStroke, dirtybird's Sunday afternoon BBQ's have quickly become a Golden Gate Park institution.
____________________________________________________________________
Desert Hearts was manifested from an abundance of positive energy in November of 2012. Starting as a 200 person renegade gathering in the Mojave, we have grown tremendously, refining our abilities to produce world class house and techno gatherings. Home of Desert Hearts Records and our roaming City Hearts party series, we aim to spread as much love as humanly possible through music and art.
Desert Hearts started as a collaboration of San Diego based DJs Mikey Lion, Lee Reynolds, Marbs, Porkchop, and Deep Jesus alongside social influencer Christopher Kristoff. Together we put in all our love dedicating endless hours of our time to creating a beautiful place where we can gather and celebrate life through music and community.

The Photographer

Bryan Minear, a Fujifilm X-Series Photographer and Delegate. 
Bryan Minear is a midwest-based designer, photographer, father, and pizza connosieur. From a young age Bryan was inspired by Ansel Adams' ethereal landscape work, which paved the direction he wanted to go as an artist. It took a lot of time and multiple detours along the way, but since 2015 Bryan has been pursuing landscape, lifestyle, and commercial photography as aggressively as one can while being a new father and still holding down a full-time job . His goal is to portray atmosphere and emotion through his work, whether he is shooting locally in the midwest or traveling to epic locations around the world. Most recently Bryan's image of the 2017 solar eclipse received viral attention, as it offered up a totally unique perspective of such a highly documented event. Bryan is an Official Fujifilm X-Photographer and a Vangaurd Professional Ambassador.

We will be meeting at CameraMall and walking around the corner to Ann Arbor's famous Graffiti Alley where Sigma Lens Expert, Marc Farb, will be giving a brief presentation about Sigma's diverse lens selection, including their advantages and applications. Lenses are a lot like tools in a tool box, each with its own strength and specific purpose to be used in different situations. What's the next lens in your tool box?

The Photographer

Marc Farb is a technical representative for Sigma. For Marc, photography is more than just a job, or a way to earn a steady income, it’s a way of life. Even more, it’s the chance to capture special moments in time and show them off to the world in a way they may never get to see them. It’s his job to preserve a moment in time and evoke a reaction from people who view his images.
Marc’s father was a Type Setter in the printing industry way back at the cross over point from lead type to negative film. So there was never a shortage of film in the house. He was given his first camera at the age of 8 years old and by the time he was 14 he had his own darkroom.
He attended the College of Boca Raton in the mid 80’s where he studied Electrical engineering as a major with a minor in computer science. Being that the school was only a few miles from an IBM facility, most of his professors were also involved in projects that would later impact the photo industry in major ways.
Fast forward 25 years, and Marc eventually became a freelance commercial photographer. From there, he took a Tech Rep position with Olympus Imaging in for the first stop in his career in the photo industry. Since then he has worked with such companies as Xrite, Ilford, Mamiya, Prophoto, and Sekonic. Marc continues to do freelance work as well and one of his clients is a major hospital system in NY city area. His work for them has included a variety of assignments for them…from publicity portraits of patients and corporate events. He is also experienced in medical and surgical photography.
Currently Marc’s assignment includes technical application support from the corporate office, as well as extensive traveling for photo conventions and trade shows for Sigma. He is proficient in Photoshop and Lightroom on a PC and Mac.
His experiences over the years have allowed him to teach classes all around the US and Canada on photographic topics that range from pixel to print, and all points between.
Marc lives on Long Island with his wife and two lovely daughters.
