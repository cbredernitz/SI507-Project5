AT&T park is transformed into a science wonderland for the concluding event of the Bay Area Science Festival, organized by UC San Francisco, – a FREE science extravaganza on Saturday November 11th, 2017 10AM-4PM. Last year, more than 30,000 people enjoyed a non-stop program chock-full of interactive exhibits, experiments, games, and shows, all meant to entertain and inspire. With more than 150 exhibits, everyone can find something that will unleash their inner scientist.

Universities, science museums, research labs, after school organizations, and local companies join forces for an unprecedented opportunity to meet scientists and engineers. Topics include health & medicine, engineering, technology, biotechnology, climate science, and so much more. This year, every exhibit will be framed as investigative questions to encourage explorations and curiosity that we hope will continue throughout the school year.

GRYFFIN 
Facebook  Twitter  Soundcloud
Last year, L.A.-based producer Gryffin delivered two heavy-hitting singles that showcased his deeply melodic take on dance music. With both tracks built on a graceful fusion of indie and electronic elements, “Heading Home (ft. Josef Salvat)” shot to #1 on Spotify’s US and Global Viral charts, while “Whole Heart” (a collaboration with Bipolar Sunshine) hit #2 on Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist. Also known for turning out several of the biggest remixes in recent years—including his masterly reworkings of Tove Lo’s “Talking Body,” CHVRCHES’ “Clearest Blue,” and Years & Years’ “Desire”—Gryffin is now offering up his latest original track and bringing his boundary-shattering artistry to bold new heights. Emotionally charged and irresistibly high-energy, the aptly named “Feel Good” is powered by hypnotic melody, massive beats, and a magnetic vocal performance from singer/songwriter Daya. Fresh off her Grammy Award win for “Don’t Let Me Down” (the multi-platinum smash that earned 2017’s Best Dance Recording prize), Daya lends her soulful vocals to Gryffin’s immaculate arrangement of heavy synth and delicate guitar work. In crafting that arrangement, Gryffin drew equally from his edgy ingenuity as a producer and his carefully honed musicality as a longtime guitarist and classically trained pianist. “The lyrics that Daya came up with had so much intensity to them—writing about that significant other in your life who puts you in a positive, happy state of mind, even when bad things may be happening in your life or in the world. I wanted the production to reflect that intensity, but at the same time create a really positive vibe,” explains Dan Griffith, who’s made music under the name Gryffin since 2014. “My goal with the song was to find that balance, and I ended up hitting it by adding a lot of synth sounds I’d never used before, and by bringing in different guitar textures and then flipping them in a new way. That’s what the Gryffin project is about overall: making electronic music but using real guitar and real piano so that there’s this organic feeling to every song.” Originally from the San Francisco area, Gryffin began his musical journey by taking up piano at age seven. In high school he added guitar to his repertoire in addition to writing his own music for the first time. While studying electrical engineering at University of Southern California, Gryffin broadened his sonic palette by diving into the world of electronic music and teaching himself production with a downloaded copy of Ableton. “I got started during a really exciting time for electronic music—I remember thinking I’d never heard sounds like that before,” recalls Griffith, who lists the early work of artists like Skrillex and Avicii among his first influences. “It all felt so fresh and new to me, and I wanted to see if I could make music like that too.""  Toward the end of his studies at USC, Griffith started posting his original productions online and soon gained attention for his inventive sensibilities. One of his earliest releases, a 2014 remix of Ellie Goulding’s “Burn” was hailed by EDM Tunes for “evok[ing] a cosmic, almost transcendental ambience with an electric guitar backdrop and airy vocal splices,” and quickly expanded his online following. “That remix was the first time I’d used guitar in a dance music production,” notes Gryffin. “All of a sudden I had all these producers messaging me to ask how I did it, which was the moment when I realized that maybe this was a direction I should keep pursuing.” As he sharpened his production skills and refined his vision, Gryffin pushed forward with releasing highly acclaimed remixes (including his 2014 take on Maroon 5’s “Animals,” which would eventually catch the attention of Interscope Records and lead to his signing). In late 2015 he made his stage debut at the SnowGlobe Music Festival, unveiling a dynamic performance that deftly introduced live instrumentation into the dance music format. With “Heading Home” arriving in early 2016—and accumulating a million plays within just a week of its release via Darkroom/Interscope Records—Gryffin next embarked on his sold-out Heading Home Tour and later played major summer festivals like Electric Forest, Camp Bisco, and Firefly. Released in August, “Whole Heart” racked up more than 35 million streams on Spotify and served as the launching point for Gryffin’s biggest tour to date: the Whole Heart Live Tour, a fall 2016 trek that spanned North America. With a highly-buzzed about set at Coachella both weekends this year and upcoming performances at A-list festivals like Lollapalooza and Governor’s Ball 2017, Gryffin thrives on creating an unforgettable stage show that blurs the line between electronic music and raw live performance. Further proving the vitality of his music, several artists have taken to performing Gryffin’s versions of their own songs when playing live. And with his name referencing the mythical half-lion/half-eagle creature and its power to soar, Gryffin aims to continue instilling a potent, uplifting energy into each of his tracks. “Part of the reason I like working with piano and guitar so much is that it adds a human element that can’t be replicated—you might not even realize it as a listener, but you feel it on some deeper level,” he says. “It builds this connection that’s really powerful, and to me that ability to make music that moves people and picks them up is the most rewarding thing in the world.”

Arriving on-stage with a pompadour and a leather jacket, G-Eazy became known as ""the James Dean of rap,"" but his music is much less troubled than that name might imply, having crossed over to the mainstream with his reinterpretation of the rock & roll classic ""Runaround Sue."" Born Gerald Earl Gillum in Oakland, California, G-Eazy launched his career while still in college at Loyola University in New Orleans, heading up a hip-hop crew named the Bay Boyz while dropping his solo debut, The Epidemic LP, in 2009. Two years later, his mixtape The Endless Summer landed with that hit redo of Dion's ""Runaround Sue."" In 2012 he released his second LP, Must Be Nice, hitting the road with Hoodie Allen and joining the Vans Warped Tour. In 2014 he returned with his first major-label release, These Things Happen (RCA). As his popularity grew in the following year, he embarked on an extensive international tour and recorded his fourth album. When It's Dark Out was released in late 2015 and included a hit duet with Bebe Rexha, ""Me, Myself & I."" Dark would go on to peak at number five on the Billboard 200 and top the R&B/Hip-Hop chart. In the summer of 2016, while on tour with Logic, YG, and Yo Gotti, Eazy appeared on Britney Spears' comeback single ""Make Me,"" which entered the Top 20 of the Hot 100. ""Some Kind of Drug,"" his single featuring Marc E. Bassy, arrived at the end of the year and would enter the singles charts in early 2017. At the beginning of the year, G-Eazy also teamed up with Carnage for the EP Step Brothers.

ZHU 
Facebook  Twitter  Soundcloud
In an ever shifting social landscape of elusive artists, ZHU is a unique voice making a name for himself without having mentioned it.  He quietly released his worldwide hit, ‘Faded’, which catapulted him into the spotlight, making him the first anonymous artist to be nominated for a Grammy. He continued to build the hype with two bodies of work before his first full length album. ZHU’s initial EP, THE NIGHTDAY, was a solo project, showcasing the raw talent and unique sounds of the budding artist. ZHU then recruited an eclectic group (Bone Thugs N Harmony, Skrillex, Trombone Shorty, and other world-class artists) for his 2015 Genesis Series EP project. Bound by no genre, the collection of songs paid homage to the great musicians that inspired ZHU with new age production and sonic design.  Dubbed “one of the most musically sophisticated of the current generation of dance music producers” by The New York Times, critics and fans His closing set in the Sahara tent at Coachella garnered comparisons to legends such as Daft Punk. Nearing 500M online streams, ZHU’s audience continues to rapidly grow.   Following topical remixes of Migo’s chart-topping “Bad and Boujee,” and Gorillaz “Andromeda,” 2017 saw the launch of ZHU's Blacklizt party concept and his hotly anticipated new EP stardustexhalemarrakechdreams featuring the standout ""Dreams"" collaboration with Nero.

Since forming in Manitoba in 1986, Propagandhi have brought an emphatic anti-fascist message to their music. Along with addressing a number of personal losses suffered in recent years, Victory Lap, the band's first full-length since 2012's Failed States, finds the band facing a landscape in which fascism is—among a certain crowd—suddenly trendy.
Victory Lap also marks Propagandhi’s first album with new guitarist Sulynn Hago, who joins Samolesky, frontman Chris Hannah, and bassist Todd Kowalski. Replacing longtime guitarist David Guillas (who appears on several tracks on Victory Lap), Hago was added to the lineup after Propagandhi put out a call for audition tapes and received over 400 responses.

Markus Schulz 
Facebook  Twitter  Soundcloud
Forged in the fires of Arizona’s seminal 90s rave scene, Schulz first went state, then with equal speed national and international. From the building blocks of progressive, trance & house, he crafted early anthems like ‘The New World’ and latter-day ones like ‘Destiny’. Caught between have been a half-dozen revered albums (most recently ‘Watch The World’), a convoy of club hits and thousands of transfixing performances, played out before untold millions. He’s helmed the scene-essential Coldharbour label for 11 years, chaired the Global DJ Broadcast radio show for 15 and remixed everyone from Moroder to Madonna. His floor-bound adventures have met with equal acclaim. Through his effortless audience affinity, flawless mixing, instinctive tune selection and now famous, stylistically vast open-till-close sets, he has wowed crowds in every major city on Earth. Markus has scaled the upper reaches of the world’s DJ rankings and charts; is a two-time winner of DJ Times’ America’s Best DJ crown and has drawn acclaim from every electronic music portal & press outlet on the planet. A regular fixture at the world’s biggest & most famous clubs, arenas and festival stages, weekly, he lays down his inimitable musical vision. In Europe, he’s floored audiences at events like Transmission, Electronic Family, Nature One and Dance Valley. He’s creamed Creamfields; gridlocked Global Gatherings and hosted his own stage at Tomorrowland. Stateside, EDC, Ultra, Nocturnal and numerous others have similarly all felt Schulz pressure. His legendary open-till-close sets, at spots like Space, Miami, LA’s Avalon, Stereo, Montreal, Amnesia, Ibiza and his International Residency at Ministry Of Sound have become rites of passage for music lovers around the world.  His most recent album ‘Watch The World’ (his sixth) included the Beatport #1 hit ‘Destiny’ and ‘Facedown’, his boundary-breaking team-up with Romanian quartet Soundland. Both stylistically and artistically, the album was a significant departure for Schulz. With more of a radio edge, it saw Markus take a lead role in its song writing process for the first time. A commercial and critical hit, ‘WTW’ reached the #1 position on iTunes’ international dance chart. The UK’s DJ Mag described it as “ambitious”, “expeditionary”, and “content-wise, for someone from his ‘bloc’, without precedent”. Giving it their Album of the Month accolade, MIXMAG called it “a work of art”. Dancing Astronaut saluted ‘Watch The World’s “meaningful lyrics played out with live instruments”, “that captured his (Markus’) authenticity as an artist”. Hailing its “impressive vocalists”, YourEDM.com summed it up simply as “a monumental release”.

The New York Times called him “a cross between Oprah Winfrey and Johnny Carson.” With a sharp wit and irreverent style, the professional golfer turned golf analyst, talk show host and sports broadcaster has made a name for himself as one of the most hilarious and irrepressible personalities in golf. Of Feherty’s live one-man show, Golf Digest said: “Uncensored and unhinged, and worth the price of admission. It really was stupendous.” The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette raves, “David Feherty was uproariously funny. It was two hours of zaniness and madcap storytelling.

"b""Citizen @ Slim's   w/ Sorority Noise, Great Grandpa""",2017-11-17T19:30:00,2017-11-17T23:59:00,"Door 7:30 / Show 8:30
Citizen’s As You Please reports from ground zero of an epidemic. Two years removed from their previous Run For Cover LP, Everybody Is Going To Heaven, Citizen’s perspective is far less sublime. As You Please is a confrontational record, incapable of turning a blind eye toward the inescapable strife. And so, songwriter Mat Kerekes pursues the source of discontent that is ravaging his friends, his family, and his Rust Belt city of Toledo, Ohio with the band’s most dynamic record to date.
On As You Please the epidemic is bigger than addiction and overdoses. There is no longer a Dream to be pursued for the friends and family surrounding Citizen. The band explores that absence and the misguided ways in which it gets filled. On opener “Jet” the kids move slow and there’s a stranger living in the narrator’s home. Both are Kerekes’ discreet way of expressing the wreckage of widespread opiate addiction. “In The Middle Of It All” might be Citizen at their most hopeful, but it also reads as agonizing expression of the ruin in the Heartland.
As You Please also showcases the growing versatility of a band seven years deep and still restless. Citizen has fully outgrown the pop punk, but also refuses to brood in post-hardcore dirges. Written over the course of a year, the record is devoid of the brutish and sinister elements found on Everybody Is Going To Heaven. Here, Citizen go beyond the grunge to shoegaze contrasts and strive for something benevolent.
There’s a spiritual core to the record that manifests in subtle ways like the ethereal vocals echoing in the breakdown of “Control,” the droning organs on “You Are A Star” or the almost operatic refrain on “In The Middle Of It All.” The finespun ways in which Citizen has written this record mark a cataclysmic breakthrough for the band. There is damage and disarray in the band member’s daily lives, but within this record all the pieces have been restored in an ornate arrangement befitting a stained glass mosaic.
In the end, As You Please tries to give strength to those in need. There are illitic factors that control, but Citizen has written a guiding light of an album out of the debris. It concludes with “You Are A Star” and “Flowerchild;” one an unstable request of confidence set to soaring progressions, the other a blistering finale that subverts expectation. As You Please might read as meek, but it represents Citizen in its most confident and expansive state.

Великолепный певец, один из самых любимых и известных российских исполнителей, Стас Михайлов, представляет свою новую программу «Лучший день»!
Совершенно новая, яркая, по-настоящему теплая программа наполнена легкими, жизнерадостными песнями, под которые, как говорит сам артист: «можно петь и танцевать, оставив все свои заботы, просто отдохнуть душой и получить заряд положительной энергии». Не обойдется на концерте и без главных, определяющих творчество Михайлова песен о любви и о поиске смысла жизни, которые так давно знакомы и любимы почитателями его таланта. Абсолютно все песни Стаса посвящены прекрасным дамам, сильным мужчинам и их взаимоотношениям, - именно поэтому они так близки и понятны каждому, пришедшему на его концерт, а завораживающий и волнующий голос артиста уж точно не оставляет шанса уйти с равнодушным!
